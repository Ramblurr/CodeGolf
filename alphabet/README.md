The alphabet in programming languages

----

Our task is to, for each letter of the (English) alphabet, write a program that prints the alphabet, in a language whose *name* starts with that letter.

**Input:** *none*

**Output:**

    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

*(trailing newline optional)*

**Rules**:

 * The scoring metric is the length of the programming language *name*, **plus** the length of the code.  Hence, C will be assessed a "penalty" of 1, while GolfScript will be assessed a penalty of 10.
 * One language/implementation per answer.  Multiple answers are encouraged.
 * The programming language should have existed prior to the writing of this post, on this eighteenth of April, in the year of our Lord two thousand and eleven.
 * If a programming language name's first letter is not an English letter, it should not be coerced into one.  It will be treated as a separate letter (meaning less competition).
 * No answer will be accepted until every English letter has a solution.
