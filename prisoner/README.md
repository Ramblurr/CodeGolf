***

This task is part of the [First Periodic Premier Programming Puzzle Push][1] and is
intended as demonstration of the new [tag:king-of-the-hill] challenge-type [proposal][2].

**The task is the write a program to play the iterated prisoner's dilemma better than other entrants.**

> Look, Vinny. We know your cellmate---what's his name? Yeah McWongski, the Nippo-Irish-Ukranian mobster--is up to something and you know what it is. 

>We're trying to be nice here, Vinnie. Givin' you a chance. 

>If you tells us what he's plannin' we'll see you get a good work assignment. 

> And if you don't...

The Rules of the Game
---
* The contest consists of a full round-robin (all possible pairing) of two contestants at a time (including self plays).
* There are 100 rounds played between each pair
* In each round each player is asked to choose between cooperating with the other player or betraying them, without knowing the other players intentions in the matter, *but* with a memory of the outcomes of previous rounds played against this opponent.
* Points are awarded for each round based on the combined choice. If both players cooperate they each get 2 points. Mutual betrayal yields 1 point each. In the mixed case, the betraying player is awarded 4 points and the cooperator is penalized by 1.
* An "official" match will be run not sooner than 10 days after posting with all the submissions I can get to work and be used to select the "accepted" winner. I have a Mac OS 10.5 box, so POSIX solutions should work, but there are linuxisms that don't. Likewise, I have no support for the win32 API. I'm willing to make a basic effort to install things, but there is a limit. The limits of my system in no way represent the limits of acceptable responses, simply those that will be included in the "offical" match.

The Programmer's interface
---
* Entries should be in the form of programs that can be run from the command line; the decision must the (sole!) output of the program on the standard output. The history of previous rounds with this opponent will be presented as a command-line argument.
* Output is either "c" (for *clam up*) or "t" (for *tell all*).
* The history is a single string of characters representing previous rounds with the most recent rounds coming earliest in the string. The characters are 
  + "K" (for *kept the faith* meaning mutual cooperation)
  + "R" (for *rat b@st@rd sold me out!*)
  + "S" (for *sucker!* meaning you benefited from a betrayal)
  + "E" (for *everyone is looking out for number one* on mutual betrayal)

The bracket
---
Four players will be provided by the author

* Angel -- always cooperates
* Devil -- always talks
* TitForTat -- Cooperates on the first round then always does as he was done by in the last round 
* Random -- 50/50

to which I will add all the entries that I can get to run.

The total score will be the sum score against all opponents (including self-plays only once and using the average score).

**Scorer Changelog:** 

 * Print sorted players and scores, and declare a winner (Casey)

Initial warriors
---
By way of example, and so that the results can be verified

**Angel**

    #include <stdio.h>
    int main(int argc, char**argv){
      printf("c\n");
      return 0;
    }

or 

    #!/bin/sh
    echo c

or

    #!/usr/bin/python
    print 'c'

**Devil**

    #include <stdio.h>
    int main(int argc, char**argv){
      printf("t\n");
      return 0;
    }

**Random**

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <time.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    int main(int argc, char**argv){
      srandom(time(0)+getpid());
      printf("%c\n",(random()%2)?'c':'t');
      return 0;
    }

Note that the scorer may re-invoke the warrior many times in one second, so a serious effort must be made to insure randomness of the results if time is being used to seed the PRNG.

**TitForTat**

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    
    int main(int argc, char**argv){
      char c='c';
      if (argv[1] && (
    		  (argv[1][0] == 'R') || (argv[1][0] == 'E')
    		  ) ) c='t';
      printf("%c\n",c);
      return 0;
    }

The first one that actually *does something* with the history.


**Running the scorer on only the provided warriors yields**

That devil, he's a craft one, and nice guys apparently come in last.
