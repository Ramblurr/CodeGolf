------
The program must print the alphabet four times: first in the normal alphabetical order, second in the order of a qwerty keyboard, third in the order of a dvorak keyboard, and lastly in reverse alphabetical order. The output should resemble this:

    abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
    qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm
    pyfgcrlaoeuidhtnsqjkxbmwvz
    zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba

The output is not case-sensitive, and you can add or omit newlines or spaces wherever you wish.

**The catch**: the program must be less than 104 characters, or, in other words, smaller than the length of the alphabet times four.

I will accept the answer with the shortest code, unless I see something really clever or interesting that I am more impressed with.

EDIT: I will accept the shortest answer on Wednesday, 4/27/2011.

EDIT2: **And the winner is** (as usual) [Golfscript][1] in 64 chars! [Second place][2], which is behind by only three chars, is also in Golfscript, with 67 chars, followed by Bash in [third place][3] with 72 chars.

But there were a few others I wanted to mention, such as [this one][4], which, depending on your definition, only used 52 "characters", and [this one][5] where he wrote it in a language he created.

There were a [few][6] [people][7] [who][8] broke an unwritten rule and did not qualify, but I will mention them just for their way of thinking without the box.
